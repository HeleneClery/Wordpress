== Description ==

Icegram is the best plugin to easily create beautiful optins and call to actions of your choice, show them to targeted visitors and convert them to customers and fans. 
Icegram totally eliminates the need to hire a developer. You can easily set it up within minutes and start recording results right away.
Most similar quality plugins are paid and still offer a lot less. Icegram is full featured, easy to use, trusted by 20,000+ users, and is still free.


= The Only Multi Purpose Plugin - a lot beyond optins =
Icegram is not the typical optin / list-building / email subscription plugin. You can do a lot more than that!

> **I have 20 Different Plugins across 3 websites but Icegram is my go-to plugin** said [JamieTurner1313](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/one-of-the-best-plugins-ive-used-3) from 60 Second Marketer,  
There are plenty of similar plug-ins like this on WordPress, but none of them provide as much bang for the buck as Icegram. I have, I'm guessing, 20 different plugins across 3 websites and this is **my go-to plugin to drive downloads of my e-books**. I especially like the A/B split testing feature. And the customer support has been very prompt. Five stars for sure.

Icegram is easy and you don’t need a developer to figure this out. Icegram lets you create optins and CTA messages in under a minute. You can choose from variety of optin types, customize it as per your liking and target it instantly. Creating an Icegram message is very simple and you don’t need technical knowledge to get it to work.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Messages look broken / formatting is weird... =

This is most likely due to CSS conflicts with current theme. We suggest using simple formatting for messages. You can also write custom CSS in your theme to fix any problems.

= Extra Line Breaks / Paragraphs in messages... =

Go to HTML mode in content editor and pull your custom HTML code all together in one line. Don't leave blank lines between two tags. That should fix it.

= How do I add custom CSS for messages? =

You can use custom CSS/JS inline in your message HTML. You can also use your theme's custom JS / CSS feature to add your changes.

= Optin Forms / Mailing service integration... =

You can embed any optin / subscription form to your Icegram messages using HTML code. You may even use a shortcode if you are using a WP plugin from your newsletter / lead capture service. 

Use the "Embed Form" button above the text editor to paste in HTML code from your mailing list service and let Icegram automatically "clean it up" for usage in Icegram messages.

= Preview does not work / not refreshing... =

Doing a browser refresh while previewing will not show your most recent changes. Click 'Preview' button to see a preview with your latest changes.

= Can I use shortcodes in a message? =

Yes! Messages support shortcodes. You may need to adjust CSS so the shortcode output looks good in your message.

= I can't find a way to do X... =

Icegram is actively developed. If you can't find your favorite feature (or have a suggestion) contact us. We'd love to hear from you.

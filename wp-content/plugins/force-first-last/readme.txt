Force the "display_name" of all users to be the user's first and last name. If those fields are empty, display name falls back to their username.

== Description ==

The display name dropdown is hidden from users. Instead, it is always set to their first and last name, or username if those fields are empty.

Display names are updated at registration or when a user profile is updated. To update existing users, visit Settings --> Force First Last and click on the link to run an initial update on your users.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `force-first-last` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

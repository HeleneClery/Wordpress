WP-Members membership plugin turns your WordPress site into a membership site.  Restrict premium content, require registration with custom fields, and more.

== Description ==

WP-Members&trade; is the original membership plugin for WordPress&reg;.  Perfect for newsletters, premium content sites, clubs/associations, and more!  

The plugin restricts selected WordPress&reg; content to registered site members.  WP-Members&trade; puts the registration process on the site front end so it is inline with your content rather than the native WP login page.  WP-Members&trade; requires __no__ modifications to your theme while remainging scalable for users who want to customize the look and feel, or want to restrict only some content.  It is a great tool for sites offering premium content to subscribers, and is adaptable to a variety of applications.

Simple to install and configure - yet customizable and scalable!

= Features: =

* Block posts, pages, both, or none by default
* Block individual posts/pages
* User login, registration, and profile integrated into your theme
* Sidebar login widget
* Create custom registration and profile fields
* Set which fields display and which are required
* Notify admin of new user registrations
* Hold new registrations for admin approval
* Setting to automatically create post excerpts
* More than 100 action and filter hooks for extensibility

By default, WordPress&reg; allows all content to be "open" and viewable by anyone and allows the site owner to restrict specific content if desired by setting a password for the post.  WP-Members&trade; operates with the reverse assumption.  It restricts all posts by default but allows the site owner to "unblock" content as desired.  WP-Members&trade; also offers the ability to change these default plugin settings.  For those that simply want to utilize the member management features and possibly restrict some content, the default setting can easily be toggled to block or unblock pages and/or posts by default.  No matter what the default setting, individual posts or pages can be set to be blocked or unblocked at the article level, overriding the default setting.

The plugin installs with additional registration fields including name, address, phone, and email. Using the WP-Members&trade; admin panel, you can also create your own custom registration fields and delete existing ones.  Changing the field order is simple with a drag-and-drop interface.  All of the registration process is inline with your theme and content rather than using the WordPress&reg; login page.  This offers you a premium content site with a professional and branded look and feel.  It also provides an opportunity for the user to register without leaving the page to do so - less clicks = more conversions.

There are also some special pages that can be created with simple shortcodes:

* A User Profile page where registered members can edit their information and change/reset their password: [wpmem_profile]
* A Registration page available for those that need a specific URL for registrations (such as email marketing or banner ad landing pages).  Note: this is strictly optional as a registration form can also be included by default on blocked content pages: [wpmem_form register]
* A Login page.  This is also an optional page as the login form is included by default on blocked content.  But if you need a specific login page, this can be created with a simple shortcode: [wpmem_form login]
* [And more shortcodes are available](http://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/users-guide/shortcodes/)!

The plugin runs on a framework with over 100 action and filter hooks so you can fully customize your implementation.

In addition to all of the features above, the plugin can be extended with premium add-on modules available from the support site rocketgeek.com.  Members of rocketgeek.com have access to support, examples, tutorials, and code snippets that will help you extend and customize the base plugin using the plugin's framework.  Some of the add-ons have their own hooks and shortcodes to further extend the plugin's extensibility.  [Visit the site for more info](http://rocketgeek.com/about/site-membership-subscription/).

= What the plugin does not do =

WP-Members does not automatically hide absolutely everything from view.  The default install of the plugin is designed to use "teaser" content to drive users to want to register.  If you want certain content or menu elements completely hidden, there are ways to do that with some customization between your theme and the plugin, but it is not automatic.


== Installation ==

WP-Members&trade; is designed to run "out-of-the-box" with no modifications to your WP installation necessary.  Please follow the installation instructions below.  __Most of the support issues that arise are a result of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions__.

= Basic Install: =

The best start is to follow the instructions in the [Quick Start Guide](http://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/quick-start-guide/).  There is also a complete [Users Guide available](http://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/users-guide/) that covers all of the plugin's features in depth.

1. Upload the `/wp-members/` directory and its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress&reg;

You are ready to begin using WP-Members&trade;.  Now follow the instructions titled "Locking down your site" below.

NOTE: Please follow instructions for installation. The vast majority of people that have marked the plugin as "broken" in the plugin compatibility form simply did not read/follow installation instructions. If something is unclear, ask for assistance.

= Locking down your site: =

* To begin restricting posts, you will need to be using the `<!--more-->` link in your posts.  Content above to the "more" split will display on summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be required to login to view the entire post.  You may also use the plugin's auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts automatically.  If you do not use the "more" tag or the auto excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive templates.
* To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for pages to be blocked. Unlike posts, the `<!--more-->` link is not necessary in the blocking of pages, but __must__ be used if you have the "show excerpts" setting turned on.
* To protect comments, we recommend setting "Users must be registered and logged in to comment" under Settings > Discussion
* Also on the page Settings > General, we recommend making sure "Anyone can register" is unchecked.  While not required, this will prevent WP's native registration from colliding with WP-Members&trade;, especially if you are using any of the WP-Members&trade; additional registration fields.
* Under Settings > Reading, we recommend that "For each article in a feed, show" is set to "Summary."  WordPress&reg; installs with full feed settings by default. If you don't change this, your feeds will show full content.
